### Hybris Demo GUI

This is a simple graphical tool that provides a way to exhibit some of the benefits of 
using [Hybris](http://github.com/pviotti/hybris) as storage library.  

Hybris Demo GUI allows you to:

 - add files to Hybris (and it shows to which clouds are uploaded)
 - remove files from Hybris 
 - remove files from single clouds to simulate faults
 - list Hybris and clouds containers
 - retrieve files from Hybris
