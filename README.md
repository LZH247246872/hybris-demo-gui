### Hybris Demo GUI

This is a simple graphical tool for demonstrating some of the benefits of 
using [Hybris](http://github.com/pviotti/hybris) as storage library.  

Hybris Demo GUI allows to:

 - adding files to Hybris (correspondently, those uploaded blobs show up on single clouds lists)
 - removing files from Hybris 
 - removing files from single clouds to simulate faults
 - corrupting files on single clouds to simulate Byzantine faults of clouds
 - listing Hybris and single clouds containers
 - retrieving files from Hybris
